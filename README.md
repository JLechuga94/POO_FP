Final project

Board game using OOP paradigm
- Player (O) you need to collect as many Diamonds ($) as you can throughout the game
- Diamonds ($) open the doors through which you access new stages
- 3 Diamonds ($) allow you to buy 1 live point
- Powerups (*) can teleport you to a random position in the board"
- 5 Powerups (*) allow you to automatically change to the next stage, after opening a door
- Avoid crashing with Monsters (M) as they eat your life points!
- Monsters (M) move randomly across the board. Be careful!
- Virus mode makes the Monsters reproduce and attack you fiercely
- Virus mode can be turned on/off Virus Mode in levels 1 to 5
- Virus mode is PERMANENT in level 6
- Remaining lives are accounted as diamonds collected
- There two types of game modes RANDOM and USER BASED
- RANDOM mode generates random boards for you to play along different stages
- USER BASED allows you to select which boards you want to try

- Improve the generation of random values
- Creation of exec .game files
- Considering changing the harcoded dimensions of matrix
- Considering changing data structure for matrix
- Test the game in order to find bugs
